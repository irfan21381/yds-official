- Gmail account with App Password (for email OTP)

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd YDS-main
```

### 2. Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in the `backend/` directory:

```env
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/yds
JWT_SECRET=supersecret
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=7d
FRONTEND_ORIGIN=http://localhost:8080
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT=465
EMAIL_USER=your@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-app-password
```

**Note**: For Gmail, you need to:
1. Enable 2-Step Verification
2. Generate an App Password: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
3. Use the generated App Password in `EMAIL_PASS`

### 3. Frontend Setup

```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in the root directory (or `frontend/` if separate):

```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
```

### 4. Database Setup

Make sure MongoDB is running:

```bash
# If using local MongoDB
mongod

# Or use MongoDB Atlas connection string in MONGO_URI
```

### 5. Seed the Database

```bash
cd backend
npm run seed
```

This will create:
- Super Admin (admin@yds.com / admin123)
- Sample College
- Manager (manager@yds.com / manager123)
- Teacher (teacher@yds.com / teacher123)
- College Students (student1@yds.com, student2@yds.com / student123)
- Public Students (public1@yds.com, public2@yds.com / public123)
- Sample Subjects
- Sample Internships

## 🔄 Migration Notes

### Switching File Uploads to S3

The codebase includes hooks for S3 integration. To enable:

1. Install AWS SDK (already in dependencies)
2. Update `backend/utils/fileProcessor.ts` to upload to S3
3. Set environment variables:
   ```env
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-key
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret
   AWS_REGION=us-east-1
   AWS_S3_BUCKET=yds-uploads
   ```

### Adding Embeddings Store

The AI service layer includes stubbed functions for RAG:
- `indexMaterial(materialId)` - Index material for vector search
- `queryRag(userId, prompt, context)` - Query RAG system

To implement:
1. Set up vector database (Pinecone, Weaviate, or MongoDB Atlas Vector Search)
2. Update `backend/services/embeddingService.ts`
3. Update `backend/services/vectorService.ts`

## 🧪 Testing

### Smoke Tests

Basic acceptance tests can be run manually:

1. **Auth Flow:**
   ```bash
   # Register
   curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/register \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"test123","role":"STUDENT","isPublicStudent":true}'
   
   # Login
   curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/login \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"test123"}'
   ```

2. **Student Stats:**
   ```bash
   curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/api/student/stats \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"
   ```

## 📝 API Documentation

For detailed API documentation, see:
- Postman Collection: `docs/postman-collection.json` (to be created)
- OpenAPI Spec: `docs/openapi.yaml` (to be created)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### CORS Errors
- Ensure `FRONTEND_ORIGIN` in backend `.env` matches your frontend URL
- Check that frontend is making requests with `credentials: true`

### MongoDB Connection Issues
- Verify MongoDB is running: `mongosh` or check MongoDB Compass
- Check `MONGO_URI` in `.env`
- For Atlas, ensure IP whitelist includes your IP

### Email Not Sending
- Verify Gmail App Password is correct
- Check `EMAIL_HOST` and `EMAIL_PORT`
- Test SMTP connection separately

### File Upload Issues
- Ensure `backend/uploads/` directory exists and is writable
- Check file size limits in `server.ts` (currently 10mb)
